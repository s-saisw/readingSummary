# Speed Reading

Pledge: I will read only abstract and introduction of recent labor economic papers. Let's see how far I can make it :/

Goal: 3 papers/week

## March, Week 1
### Powell (2020), JLE - Does labor supply respond to transitory income?
- What is the impact of transitory income on short-term labor supply?
- PIH posits that small one-time payment should not affect short term behavior of household.
- This paper uses the natural experiment on 2008 tax rebates. The timing of rebates is randomly determined based on the last 2 digits of household head social security number.
- It finds that workers reduce hours in response to rebate receipt and there is no impact on extensive margin.

### Bingley et al. (2020), JLE - Opportunity costs of mandatory military service
- What is the impact of peacetime mandatory military service on earnings, schooling, health, and crime?
- This paper utilizes the randomness of military draft as exogenous variation for military service.
- High-ability men face 7% reduction on lifetime earnings. There is no impact on health and criminal activity.
- One contribution of this paper is that it distinguishes wartime VS wartime service.

### Valetta er al. (2020), JLE - Involuntary part-time employment
- What contribute to involuntary part-time work (working part-time for economic reasons)?
- This paper focuses on the Great US Recession (2003-2016).
- The causes of involuntary part-time work are cyclical and structural factors (i.e. demand and supply determinants e.g. industry employment shares, labor costs, population demographics).
- It finds that the effect cyclical factors disappears after 2010 but that of structural factors persists to 2016.

## March, Week 2
### Breining et al. (2020), JLE - Birth order & Deliquency
- This paper employs data sets from two different settings: Denmark and Florida.
- Second-born boys are more likely to be enter criminal justice system than first borns. 
- The effect is likely to come through parental time investment. The use of daycare is more intensive for the second born boys.
