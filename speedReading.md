# Speed Reading

Pledge: I will read only abstract and introduction of recent labor economic papers and try to understand the contents. Let's see how far I can make it :/

Goal: 3 papers/week

## Week 1
### Powell (2020), JEL
- What is the impact of transitory income on short-term labor supply?
- PIH posits that small one-time payment should not affect short term behavior of household.
- This paper uses the natural experiment on 2008 tax rebates. The timing of rebates is randomly determined based on the last 2 digits of household head social security number.
- It finds that workers reduce hours in response to rebate receipt and there is no impact on extensive margin.
