# Speed Reading

Pledge: I will read only abstract and introduction of recent labor economic papers. Let's see how far I can make it :sweat_smile:

Goal: 3 papers/week

:fire: &rarr; This one is lit! i.e. personal favorite

## March, Week 1
### Powell (2020), JLE - Does labor supply respond to transitory income?
- What is the impact of transitory income on short-term labor supply?
- PIH posits that small one-time payment should not affect short term behavior of household.
- This paper uses the natural experiment on 2008 tax rebates. The timing of rebates is randomly determined based on the last 2 digits of household head social security number.
- It finds that workers reduce hours in response to rebate receipt and there is no impact on extensive margin.

### Bingley et al. (2020), JLE - Opportunity costs of mandatory military service :fire:
- What is the impact of peacetime mandatory military service on earnings, schooling, health, and crime?
- This paper utilizes the randomness of military draft as exogenous variation for military service.
- High-ability men face 7% reduction on lifetime earnings. There is no impact on health and criminal activity.
- One contribution of this paper is that it distinguishes wartime VS wartime service.

### Valetta er al. (2020), JLE - Involuntary part-time employment
- What contribute to involuntary part-time work (working part-time for economic reasons)?
- This paper focuses on the Great US Recession (2003-2016).
- The causes of involuntary part-time work are cyclical and structural factors (i.e. demand and supply determinants e.g. industry employment shares, labor costs, population demographics)
- It finds that the effect cyclical factors disappears after 2010 but that of structural factors persists to 2016.

## March, Week 2
### Breining et al. (2020), JLE - Birth order & Deliquency
- Are younger siblings more deliquent that their older ones?
- This paper employs data sets from two different settings: Denmark and Florida.
- Second-born boys are more likely to be enter criminal justice system than first borns. 
- The effect is likely to come through parental time investment. The use of daycare is more intensive for the second born boys.

### Felfe et al. (2020), JLE - Birthright citizenship
- Does the introduction of birthright citizenship improve immigrant's educational outcomes?
- This paper employs a natural experiment in Germany. Before 2000, citizenship only comes from blood, but after that anyone born within German territory become German citizens. It uses Jan 1, 2000 as cutoff and compares individuals born shortly before and shortly after the cutoff date.
- The introduction of birthright citizenship leads to increase in non-compulsory preschool attendance.
- Exogeneity of cutoff date?

### Rizzica (2020), JLE - Aspiration & higher education :fire:
- What is the impact of an outreach policy &rarr; aspiration &rarr; college enrollment?
- It is unclear in the literature whether pupils from low socioeconomic background do not enroll in college because of financial constraint or because of their personal preference. 
- This paper utilizes a natural experiment in the UK. Widening participation (WP) policy is imposed on chidren whose neighborhood has college enrollment rate lower than certain threshold value. &rarr; RDD
- WP policy raises aspiration but does not raise college enrollment rate. There is also no impact on cognitive skills.
- This implies financial constraint, and/or lower skills.

## March, Week 3
### Mezza et al. (2020), JLE - Student loans & homeownership
- What is the effect of student loan debt to subsequent homeownership?
- This paper combines IV method with treatment-control group framework. Treatment group = those who went to public universities, Control group = others. Control group helps absorbs the effect of state's economic conditions. 
- Nevertheless, there may be some OVB e.g. career prospect. This paper employs state average tuition as IV. State average tuition fee satisfies exclusion restriction because it does not correlate with any individual characteristic. 
- Caveat: selection into treatment group
- It finds that student loans hinder homeownership.

### Ginja et al. (2020), JLE - Parental leave, labor supply decision, & children's long-run outcomes
- What is the effect of parental leave benefits &rarr; labor supply &rarr; child outcome?
- Mothers can keep the parental leave benefits for if two children were born within a prespecified interval. In 1980, the interval was increased to 24 months, and in 1986, to 30 months &rarr; RDD
- The policy reduces labor supply but there is no impact on disposable income &larr; labor earnings are compensated by leave benefits. There are effects only in the short run.
- The policy increases the educational outcome of the older child but not the younger one. &rarr; birth spacing literature

### Doleac et al. (2020), JLE - Hidden criminal histories & statistical discrimination :fire:
- Ban the Box (BTB) policy prevents employers asking job applicants' criminal records. However, this policy may increase statistical discrimination against certain demographic groups.
- What is the impact of BTB policy on probability of employment?
- This paper employs the timing and adoption of BTB policy as source of exogenous variation.
- If BTB does not exacerbate statistical discrimination, we expect to see an increase in employment among groups with lots of ex-offenders. If BTB exacerbates discrimination, we will see BTB reducing employment of this group but not others.
- Young low-skilled black men are less employed after BTB is imposed.Older, low-skilled black men and older, low-skilled Hispanic women are significantly more likely to be employed after BTB. &rarr; statistical-based discrimination (not taste-based)

## March, Week 4
### Bates (2020), JLE - Public & private employer learning :fire:
- Current employer knows more about the worker than other prospective employers &rarr; employer and worker enjoy rents from employment relationship &rarr; MPL>wage. If information on productivity becomes available for employers, workers should move accordingly.
- However, evidence for this story is scarce because there usually is no data set that contains worker's productivity nor exogenous variation for informational setting.
- Some districts adopt value-added (VA) measure to quantify teacher's productivity. 
- In districts with public VA measure, good teachers move within districts to better schools. In districts with private VA, bad teachers move to another district.

### Fryer Jr. & Howard-Noveck (2020), JLE - High dosage tutoring
- What is the impact of intensive tutoring for disadvantaged groups?
- This study uses RCT at school-level.
- High-dosage tutoring has more positive impact on black students than hispanic students.
- Implication: teachers who have the same students all day are able to better understand the “state” their students are in relative to teachers who see many more students for an hour a day

### Marinescu & Wolthoff (2020) - Job titles
- What is the relationship between wage and labor supply?
- Within the same occupation, wage and labor supply has negative relationship. However, once job title is controlled for, the relationship becomes positive.
- Job titles may be a better control for the job characteristics than 6-digit SOC since it is determined by employer rather than researcher and therefore better reflects hierachy and specialization.
