# Speed Reading

Pledge: I will read only abstract and introduction of recent labor economic papers. Let's see how far I can make it :/

Goal: 3 papers/week

## March, Week 1
### Powell (2020), JLE - Does labor supply respond to transitory income?
- What is the impact of transitory income on short-term labor supply?
- PIH posits that small one-time payment should not affect short term behavior of household.
- This paper uses the natural experiment on 2008 tax rebates. The timing of rebates is randomly determined based on the last 2 digits of household head social security number.
- It finds that workers reduce hours in response to rebate receipt and there is no impact on extensive margin.

### Bingley et al. (2020), JLE - Opportunity costs of mandatory military service
- What is the impact of peacetime mandatory military service on earnings, schooling, health, and crime?
- This paper utilizes the randomness of military draft as exogenous variation for military service.
- High-ability men face 7% reduction on lifetime earnings. There is no impact on health and criminal activity.
- One contribution of this paper is that it distinguishes wartime VS wartime service.

### Valetta er al. (2020), JLE - Involuntary part-time employment
- What contribute to involuntary part-time work (working part-time for economic reasons)?
- This paper focuses on the Great US Recession (2003-2016).
- The causes of involuntary part-time work are cyclical and structural factors (i.e. demand and supply determinants e.g. industry employment shares, labor costs, population demographics).
- It finds that the effect cyclical factors disappears after 2010 but that of structural factors persists to 2016.

## March, Week 2
### Breining et al. (2020), JLE - Birth order & Deliquency
- Are younger siblings more deliquent that their older ones?
- This paper employs data sets from two different settings: Denmark and Florida.
- Second-born boys are more likely to be enter criminal justice system than first borns. 
- The effect is likely to come through parental time investment. The use of daycare is more intensive for the second born boys.

### Felfe et al. (2020), JLE - Birthright citizenship
- Does the introduction of birthright citizenship improve immigrant's educational outcomes?
- This paper employs a natural experiment in Germany. Before 2000, citizenship only comes from blood, but after that anyone born within German territory become German citizens. It uses Jan 1, 2000 as cutoff and compares individuals born shortly before and shortly after the cutoff date.
- The introduction of birthright citizenship leads to increase in non-compulsory preschool attendance.
- Exogeneity of cutoff date?

### Rizzica (2020), JLE - Aspiration & higher education
- What is the impact of an outreach policy &rarr; aspiration &rarr; college enrollment?
- It is unclear in the literature whether pupils from low socioeconomic background do not enroll in college because of financial constraint or because of their personal preference. 
- This paper utilizes a natural experiment in the UK. Widening participation (WP) policy is imposed on chidren whose neighborhood has college enrollment rate lower than certain threshold value. &rarr; RDD
- WP policy raises aspiration but does not raise college enrollment rate. There is also no impact on cognitive skills.
- This implies financial constraint, and/or lower skills.

## March, Week 3
### Mezza et al. (2020), JLE - Student loans & homeownership
- What is the effect of student loan debt to subsequent homeownership?
- This paper combines IV method with treatment-control group framework. Treatment group = those who went to public universities, Control group = others. Control group helps absorbs the effect of state's economic conditions. 
- Nevertheless, there may be some OMV e.g. career prospect. This paper employs state average tuition as IV. State average tuition fee satisfies exclusion restriction because it does not correlate with any individual characteristic. 
- Caveat: selection into treatment group
- It finds that student loans hinder homeownership.
