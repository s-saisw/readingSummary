## Parental leave policy

Most of the previous studies from Japan, including Higuchi (1994), Shigeno and Ookusa (1998), Suruga and Cho (2003), Imada and Ikeda (2006) and Sato and Ma (2007), have found that PL provision increases female employment. They use variation in leave availability across employers or leave-taking by employees, but their estimates are likely to suffer biases due to the self-selection into PL take-up and/or employers that offer generous PL. - Yamaguchi (2017)

### Yamaguchi (2016)
- **Data**: Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers 1993-2012
- **Sample restriction**: Married women who completed schooling and are not self-employed
- **Y**: Female employment
- **X**: Parental leave policy (Job protection & Cash benefit)
- **Change in X**: 
    - 1992: Job protection with no cash benefit for regular workers
    - 1995: Job protection with 25% cash benefit for regular workers
    - 2001: Job protection with 40% cash benefit for regular workers
    - 2005: Job protection with 40% cash benefit for regular/non-regular workers workers
    - 2007: Job protection with 50% cash benefit for regular/non-regular workers workers
- **Beta** (Counterfactual exercise): 
    - One (Three) year of job protection increases the probability of work after child-bearing by 0.54 (0.53).
    - Cash benefits have little effect.

### Asai (2012)
- **Data**: Japanese Employment Status Survey 1997-2002
- **Sample restriction**: Mothers with regular employment status 3 years before giving birth to first child
- **Y**: Mother's job continuity i.e. mother remains in regular employment with the same employer
- **X**: Reform eligibility
- **Change in X**: Amount of cash benefit was raised from 25% to 40% of wage in 2001. This paper compares outcomes of mothers before and after the reform.
- **Beta**: Increase in the amount of cash benefit did not increase job continutiy

## Childcare Facility

### Asai et al. (2016)
- **Data**: Prefecture panel data constructed from Japanese quinquennial census 1990-2010
- **Sample restriction**: Households with two parents and children under age 6
- **Y**: Maternal employment rate at prefecture level
- **X**: Childcare availability
    - measured by capacity data drawn from annual Report on SocialWelfare Administration and Services and child population data from the Japanese quinquennial census 1990-2010.
- **Change in X**: 
    - Since early 1990s, the government launched a series of policies to raise childcare capacity.
    - Variation comes from differential capacity across prefectures.
        - In large cities, capacity increased because of the policies.
        - In small cities, capacity remains almost constant because of the decline in number of child population.
- **Beta**: 
    - There is no correlation between childcare availability and maternal employment.
    - This is because mothers substitute accredited childcare facility by informal childcare arrangement provided by grandparents.

### Nishitateno & Shikata (2017)
- **Data**: Authors' own data set constructed at municipality level 2000, 2005, 2010 from Population Census and Survey of Welfare Institutions
- **Sample restriction**: Mothers with age 0-5 years
- **Y**: Maternal employment rate
- **X**: Daycare accessibility
    - Quota of daycare/population of children age 0-5
- **Change in X**: 
    - 2001 "Zero Wait-listed Children" policy to increase quota of daycare
    - Accessibility increased by 7 percentage points from 2001 to 2010
- **Beta**: One percentage points increase in daycare accessibilty increases maternal employment rate by 0.11 percentage points

### Nishitateno (2019)
- **Data**: Authors' own data set constructed at municipality level 2000, 2005, 2010 from Population Census and Survey of Welfare Institutions
- **Sample restriction**: 
- **Y**: Maternal employment rate
- **X**: Privatization of daycare
    - measured by privatization rate in the municipality
- **Change in X**: 
    - Daycare privatization rate increases from 47.7% in 2000 to 58.7% in 2010
- **Beta**: 
    - 1 percentage points increase in privatized day care increases maternal employment rate by 0.02 percentage points.

### Takaku (2019)
- **Data**: Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers 1993-2012
- **Sample restriction**: Mothers whose first-born went to daycare as pre-schoolers
- **Y**: Whether mother works
- **X**: Nuclear VS Three-generation household, timing of school entry of the child
- **Change in X**: (No particular policy change)
- **Beta**: 
    - It is more difficult for mothers of nuclear families to work
    - The difference is more striking during the time of school entry

## Gender norm
### Rodríguez-Planas & Tanaka (2018)
- **Data**: National Family Research of Japan Survey 1999, 2004, 2009
- **Sample restriction**: Women between 28-59 years old
- **Y**: Whether the person is working
- **X**: Share of women with non-traditional gender norms
    - Somewhat disagreeing with the statement *men should work outside and women should look after the family*
- **Change in X**: 
    - Variation comes from different social norms between demographic groups.
    - Demographic groups are defined by birth cohort, educational attainment level, survey-year, and prefecture.
- **Beta**: 
    - One percentage point increase in share of individuals with non-traditional beliefs increases the standard deviation of women’s decision to work by 0.016 percentage points.
    - No impact on decision to work part-time

## Fertility

### Griffen et al. (2015)
- **Data**: Longitudinal Survey of Newborns in the 21st Century,
- **Sample restriction**: Japanese babies born between January 10–17 and July 10–17, 2001.
- **Y**: Maternal employment
- **X**: Number of children
    - Number of children is instrumented by indicator for a twin birth.
- **Change in X**: 
    - Since 2012, Abe government has attempted to raise fertility rate in Japan.
- **Beta**: 
    - Number of children have little effect on maternal employment after instrumenting for twin occurrence.
    - Occurrence of twins increases maternal labor supply in the long run.
    - Effect seems to come from higher child cost and the absence of younger child in families with twins.
