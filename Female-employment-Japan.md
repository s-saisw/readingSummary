## Parental leave policy


Most of the previous studies from Japan, including Higuchi (1994), Shigeno and Ookusa (1998), Suruga and Cho (2003), Imada and Ikeda (2006) and Sato and Ma (2007), have found that PL provision increases female employment. They use variation in leave availability across employers or leave-taking by employees, but their estimates are likely to suffer biases due to the self-selection into PL take-up and/or employers that offer generous PL. - Yamaguchi (2017)

### Yamaguchi (2016)
- **Data**: Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers 1993-2012
- **Sample restriction**: Married women who completed schooling and are not self-employed
- **Y**: Female employment
- **X**: Parental leave policy (Job protection & Cash benefit)
- **Change in X**: 
    - 1992: Job protection with no cash benefit for regular workers
    - 1995: Job protection with 25% cash benefit for regular workers
    - 2001: Job protection with 40% cash benefit for regular workers
    - 2005: Job protection with 40% cash benefit for regular/non-regular workers workers
    - 2007: Job protection with 50% cash benefit for regular/non-regular workers workers
- **Beta** (Counterfactual exercise): 
    - One (Three) year of job protection increases the probability of work after child-bearing by 0.54 (0.53).
    - Cash benefits have little effect.

### Asai (2012)
- **Data**: Japanese Employment Status Survey 1997-2002
- **Sample restriction**: Mothers with regular employment status 3 years before giving birth to first child
- **Y**: Mother's job continuity i.e. mother remains in regular employment with the same employer
- **X**: Reform eligibility
- **Change in X**: Amount of cash benefit was raised from 25% to 40% of wage in 2001. This paper compares outcomes of mothers before and after the reform.
- **Beta**: Increase in the amount of cash benefit did not increase job continutiy

## Childcare facility

### Asai et al. (2016)
- **Data**: Prefecture panel data constructed from Japanese quinquennial census 1990-2010
- **Sample restriction**: Households with two parents and children under age 6
- **Y**: Maternal employment rate at prefecture level
- **X**: Childcare availability
    - measured by capacity data drawn from annual Report on SocialWelfare Administration and Services and child population data from the Japanese quinquennial census 1990-2010.
- **Change in X**: 
    - Since early 1990s, the government launched a series of policies to raise childcare capacity.
    - Variation comes from differential capacity across prefectures.
        - In large cities, capacity increased because of the policies.
        - In small cities, capacity remains almost constant because of the decline in number of child population.
- **Beta**: 
    - There is no correlation between childcare availability and maternal employment.
    - This is because mothers substitute accredited childcare facility by informal childcare arrangement provided by grandparents.

## Gender social norm
### Rodríguez-Planas & Tanaka (2018)
- **Data**: National Family Research of Japan Survey 1999, 2004, 2009
- **Sample restriction**: Women between 28-59 years old
- **Y**: Whether the person is working
- **X**: Share of women with non-traditional gender norms
    - Somewhat disagreeing with the statement *men should work outside and women should look after the family*
- **Change in X**: 
    - Variation comes from different social norms between demographic groups.
    - Demographic groups are defined by birth cohort, educational attainment level, survey-year, and prefecture.
- **Beta**: 
    - One percentage point increase in share of individuals with non-traditional beliefs increases the standard deviation of women’s decision to work by 0.016 percentage points.
    - No impact on decision to work part-time
