Possible explanations for why wage does not change after labor supply increases.

1. Labor supply curve shifts outward. Wage decreases. Return to capital increases. Employer expands capital. Labor demand curve also shifts outward.
Possible capital: tractor, thresher, machine to put in seeds/pesticide, sprinkler, lawnmower
cf. Long-run impact of immigration

2. Labor demand curve is elastic. -> Theoretically ambiguous

3. Efficiency-wage : employer pays above subsistence level to ensure productivity through nutrition -> labor supply shock still changes the non-shirk labor supply curve -> wage goes down
cf. Leibenstein (1957), Mazumdar (1959)

4. Average product of labor: employer pays average product of labor because they want to attract farmers to not work in their family farms.
cf. Lewis (1954)
